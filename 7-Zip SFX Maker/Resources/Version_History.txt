FREEWARE utility to view, modify, add, rename 
and delete resources in Win32 executables and
resource files. Incorporates an internal 
resource compiler and decompiler. Works on 
Win9x, WinNT, Win2000 and WinXP.

----------------------------------------------
Version History:
----------------------------------------------

24 March 2002 (Version 3.4.0):

  * 32bit Resource Files (*.res) can now also 
  be viewed and edited.
  * Added support for the following Dialog 
  extended style flags: WS_EX_LAYERED,
  WS_EX_NOINHERITLAYOUT, WS_EX_LAYOUTRTL and  
  WS_EX_NOACTIVATE.
  * All resource language ids (except those for 
  cursors and icons) can now be easily changed.
  * Bug Fix: LBS_NOINTEGRALHEIGHT and 
  LBS_MULTICOLUMN listbox style flags in dialogs 
  previously could not be combined.

14 January 2002 (Version 3.3.4):

  * Bug fix: Occasional error when trying to 
  compile large plain text resources.
  * Bug fix: Occasional error (introduced in 
  the previous update) when replacing icons.

6 January 2002 (Version 3.3.3):

  * Searching has been speeded up dramatically.
  * Numerous other minor improvements.

23 December 2001 (Version 3.3.2):

  * Bug fix: Export tables were being corrupted
    when modifying Dlls compiled with LCC-Win32.
  * Bug fix: Minor resource leak plugged.
  * Bug fix: Progressbar styles PBS_SMOOTH 
    and PBS_VERTICAL in resource Dialogs 
    were not being decompiled.  

7 December 2001 (Version 3.3.1):

  * Resources can now be renamed either via 
  the popup menu of the treeview control or 
  via the main menu (once the specific resource 
  has been selected in the treeview control).

  * Numerous other minor improvements and 
  bug fixes.

29 October 2001 (Version 3.2.10):

  * Bug fix: Resource Hacker™ caused an 
  "access violation" occasionally when trying
  to open 16bit executables (which aren't
  supported).

  * Bug fix: Occasional errors occured when 
  decompiling messagetables and accelerators. 

  * Bug fix: Closing Resource Hacker™ was 
  delayed due to Windows caching *.ini 
  updates. This made running RH scripts 
  within batch files difficult. 

7 August 2001 (Version 3.2.9):

  * Bug fix: Resource Hacker™ will now display 
  and edit resources stored in sections other 
  than the '.rsrc' section.

  * Bug fix: When closing Resource Hacker™ a 
  delayed closure of a mutex handle made running 
  RH scripts within batch files difficult.

  * Bug fix: Another commandline bug fixed.

  * Several minor functional improvements.

16 June 2001 (Version 3.2.8):

  * When editing dialog controls and the Editor 
  has focus, the control corresponding to the 
  current insertion point (if any) will be 
  highlighted automatically in the dialog preview.

  * When resources cannot be viewed due to 
  non-standard resource layouts (eg when an "EXE 
  compressor" has been used to shrink the file),
  a message to this effect will now be displayed.

  * Individual resource items' size will now be 
  displayed in the statusbar.

  * Bug fix: Commandline support was partially
  broken in a previous update.

  * Bug fix: Should now run on Win95 machines which
  still have the original ComCtl32.dll. 

  * Bug fix: Should now run on Win95 and Win98 
  machines which do not have ImageHlp.dll installed.
  (ImageHlp.dll is included on the Win98 install CD
  and is installed automatically with Internet 
  Explorer 3 or greater.)

8 April 2001 (Version 3.2.7):

  * DS_SETFONT is no longer decompiled into the
  STYLE statement of Dialog resources to avoid
  problems when recompiling scripts using 
  Microsoft's resource compiler.

  * Extended Dialog FONT definitions (font 
  weight, italics etc) are no longer displayed 
  in decompiled scripts unless they have been 
  changed to non-default values. This avoids 
  problems when trying to recompile these 
  scripts with both MS's and Borland's resource 
  compilers which still do not support full font 
  definitions for Dialogs.

  * Bug fix: Occasional error when saving
  non-standard resource types to *.res files.

10 March 2001 (Version 3.2.6):

  * Resources can now be added to executables
  which previously did not contain resources.

  Unicode to multibyte character conversion
  was causing problems with some non-English
  resources.

3 March 2001 (Version 3.2.5):

  * Enhanced the Dialog Editor's functionality 
  when adding new controls.
  * The line number of Editor's insertion point 
  is now displayed on the left of the statusbar.
  * The Menu Preview is now able to display 
  popup menus which don't have a caption.
  * Bug fix (introduced in the previous update):
  Dialogs displaying bitmaps would no longer 
  always display the correct size of the bitmap.
  * Other minor improvements.

20 February 2001 (Version 3.2.4):

  * A Dialog Editor has been added and can be 
  activated by right clicking on a Dialog Preview.
  * Plain text resources can now be modified and 
  recompiled using the internal editor.
  * Bug-fix: Dialog scripts were not being 
  displayed if either the dialog width or 
  dialog height equalled zero.
  * Bug-fix: Occasionally a valid menu script 
  would raise an error when compiling.
  * Bug-fix: StringTable entries with more than 
  50 special characters (\t,\n etc) could not be 
  viewed and raised an error.


28 January 2001 (Version 3.2.3):

  * The Dialog Preview/Designer is now detached 
  from the main window.
  * Whenever a control is selected in the 
  Dialog Designer, its definition in the script will also 
  be flagged with a red marker.
  * Several minor bug fixes.

14 January 2001 (Version 3.2.2):

  * Programs which are modified will now have their 
  CheckSums updated too.
  * Combobox controls in the preview dialog now

  - DIALOG scripts containing MENU or CLASS statements 
  would occasionally raise an error on compiling. 
  - FONT statement in DIALOGEX scripts now fully supports 
  FontWeight, Italic and FontCharset parameters.
  - Several other minor bug fixes/cosmetic improvements.

1 January 2001 (Version 3.1):

  * Most-Recently-Used file list added to File menu.

  of any binary type, no longer needing to compile 
  them into *.res files first. This includes, but is not 
  restricted to image files (*.ico, *.cur, *.bmp).

  of Resource Hacker™ (apart from viewing resources) 
  can now be accessed from the commandline 
  without having to open Resource Hacker™.

  * Added Any File (*.*) option to Open File Dialog
  File types (no longer limited to exe, dll, ocx and

  containing text compiled in both ANSI and 
  UNICODE formats.

  * "File Save" menu option added. The original 
  file is backed up if a backup copy does not 
  already exist. (eg: MyProgram.exe will be copied 
  to MyProgram_original.exe, unless it already 
  exists, before being modified.) 

  * Bug Fix: VersionInfo resources would 
  occasionally not decompile correctly.
