<div class="wikidoc"><p>After an install, the Management Application will be launched showing the default setup.</p>  <p>This will be a direct mirror of Drive C with a default delay of over 32 seconds.</p>  <p>The management window is split into three areas</p>  <ol>   <li>The File System</li>    <li>Merge Points</li>    <li>Expected Output</li> </ol>  <p><u>The File System </u>window shows what can be “Seen” as a potential source for the merge points. These can be opened and will show directories only. once you have selected a source, it can be dragged and dropped into the Merge Points area.</p>  <p><u>The Merge Points</u>, can be reordered and deleted in case mistakes a re made. The order in this window is used to determines the preference order for filling the storage locations.</p>  <p><u>The Expected Output</u>, allows you to traverse over the merged directories to see if the structure is correct. This will also show duplicate filenames if they exist, so please expand all the directories to see if any collisions have occurred. The system will not scan, as this is resource and time expensive.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Below is an example of 3 small HDD’s (50MB), that have been used to set up an initial merge size of 150 MB.</p>  <ul>   <li>The “Hold Of Bytes” was set to 10MB, meaning that when a new file was to be placed onto the storage, and there is less than that number of bytes, it would move to the next in order.</li>    <li>The configuration was then sent to the Liquesce Service via the menu operation “<u>S</u>end Configuration”</li>    <li>The then Music Directory was created, and the Artist was copied into it (On the “N” drive).</li>    <li>The Liquesce Service then spread the directory structure across the drives (See right hand explorer window)</li>    <li>The management application was then refreshed and now you can see that it shows all the files from the album appearing as a single listing (Bottom window)</li>    <li>Right clicking on the properties of the Music directory within the “N” drive shows that this is read as a single system.</li> </ul>  <p><a href="http://download.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=Liquesce&DownloadId=156152"><img style="border-bottom:0px;border-left:0px;display:inline;border-top:0px;border-right:0px" title="Merge Results" border=0 alt="Merge Results" src="http://download.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=Liquesce&DownloadId=156153" width=1085 height=693></a></p></div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
