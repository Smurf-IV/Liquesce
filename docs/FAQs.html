<h2><strong>Do Liquesce views have their own share user/group security ?</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Currently - Whatever the system has set up for access, should be replicated when the service restarts
<ul>
<li>But you need to let Liquesce know what to restore when it starts up (Which is after the lanmanserver !!)
</li><li>i.e. You need to store these in Liquesce; see <a href="http://liquesce.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Advanced Settings&referringTitle=FAQs">

<h2><a name="formats">What file systems does this work with?</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>This will <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span></strong> work with FAT or FAT32 formats,
</li><li>Put simply - It does not care for the FS as long as ACL system calls work
<ul>
<li>If the Windows OS can read / write to it, then <em>according to the MSDN</em>, this should be able to as well.
</li></ul>
</li><li>I have NTFS (3 / 4) and exFat currently being used. </li></ul>

<h2><a name="Directories">Directories:</a></h2>
<h2>What Happens when a directory is renamed?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Internal to the dokan driver this is presented as a directory move to a new name.
</li><li>The rename will then be cascaded to all directories that make up that current view.
</li></ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Happens when a directory is Moved?</h2>
<ul>
<li>All Spanned directories are moved in preference order </li><li>The Target drive will be the 1st in the list </li><li>This means that if a file has a duplicate, the highest in the preference order (And the one that would have been presented in the Mount view) will be written first
</li><li>A delete operation will follow the copy to perform an internal transaction using the windows Kernel MoveFileEx(...)
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Happens when a directory is Deleted?</h2>
<ul>
<li>All the directories that make up the current known view will be deleted. </li><li>Recursion will <em>not</em>&nbsp; be performed by this service, as that is <em>
supposed</em> to have been taken care of by the &ldquo;<em>Caller application</em>&rdquo;
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Happens when a directory is moved from the Mount to an existing source?</h2>
<ul>
<li>The operation should succeed but beware of the scenario in <a href="http://liquesce.codeplex.com/workitem/7096">
Delete directory (If spanned) will not delete &quot;All&quot; sources of that directory</a>
<ul>
<li>This means that if move from the Mount to the same location in the highest drive, all data will be deleted.
</li><li>This is due to the Dokan driver not being informed of anything going on outside of it's mount (i.e. the copy before delete)
</li></ul>
</li><li>So basically <span style="font-size:small"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Do not do that !</span></span></strong>
</span></li></ul>
